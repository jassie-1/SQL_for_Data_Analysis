I have made 3 tables named "Customers", "Products" and "Orders" for these queries.
I have used queries/clauses like "SELECT", "WHERE", "ORDER BY", "GROUP BY...HAVING",
"GROUP BY with AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS", "LIKE", "JOINS". I have also created "VIEWS", 
"INDEXES" and "SUBQUERIES" to gain hands-on experience on SQL queries through
this task.
